# Cholesky Algorithm:

Was already graded so I turned off the outputs, to turn back on, change "polyfitting_plot" to 1 on line 50 in driver program

To change polynomial degree, change "poly" on line 62 to desired degree in driver program

# Householder Algorithm:

Runs by default. To change polynomial degree, change "poly" on line 92 to desired polynomial in driver program
